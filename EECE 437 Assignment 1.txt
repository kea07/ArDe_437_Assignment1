The code is seperated to header and cpp files. There are 3 main clas heirerchies: TAType,
TABoolOperations and TAArithmetics where all other classes inherit from. The code is easy 
to add on for future development. The code is easy to understand but it included no enough
comments. All problems asked for were implemented except that the arithmetic operations
do not work and there are no runtime exceptions. For the arithmetics, i couldve made TAInt
inherit from TADouble and upon adding or subtracting i can cast the double return value to 
int and the problem would be solved. I added an abstract class called type that has
all the prmitave types along with TAArray and TAPair inherit from it. This made the
implementation of TAArray and TAPair alot easier.
